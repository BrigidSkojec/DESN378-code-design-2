    </ul>

    <p>Penguins are flightless, carnivorous birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, known for their black-and-white camouflage (countershading) that helps them hide from predators in the water, where they are expert divers, using solid bones for better underwater maneuverability and their feet as rudders, with diets of fish, squid, and krill.</p>
