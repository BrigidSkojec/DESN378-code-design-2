## Project #1: Portfolio Toggle Theme for Light and Dark
In this project, we had to incorporate variable.css with tokens: 
My system is relatively simple. I have the main brand colors, some greys, fonts, and sizes. Only a few colors change in the dark mode, so I didn't need a bunch of other options. I changed the white spaces in the website, as they are the brightest areas. And I changed them to a sort of purple-grey. 
As well as add a button with a toggle that would switch between light and dark.
Make sure the browser remembers the user's theme choice after a refresh. 
If the user doesn't have a saved theme, search the system for the user's preference. 
And to make sure accessibility is on for reduced motion.
