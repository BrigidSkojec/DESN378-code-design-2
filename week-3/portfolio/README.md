## Project #1: Portfolio Toggle Theme for Light and Dark
In this project, we had to incorporate variable.css with tokens. 
Add a button with a toggle that would switch between light and dark.
Make sure the browser remembers the user's theme choice after a refresh. 
If the user doesn't have a saved theme, search the system for the user's preference. 
And to make sure accessibility is on for reduced motion.
