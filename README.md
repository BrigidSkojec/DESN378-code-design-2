## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I would say all of it was new for me. I would say the thing I learned is how to make a variable and give it a value. With the let and const functions. 
let allows you to reassign the value, and const does not. I believe it would be let variable = value. I can also feel myself teetering on the edge of understanding.
It is so confusing to me right now, but it is almost like the concepts and formatting are on the tip of my tongue. Which makes me hopeful I will get to a place 
where I am more comfortable.
​
​
### What Was Hard
 It is a bit overwhelming, seeing that I have forgotten so much information from Web 1. I do not know the best way to refresh that knowledge. And it worries me that having forgotten
 how to do a majority of HTML and CSS will negatively impact my ability to learn Java. The behavioral layer assignment, was hard for me, because I feel like a lot of different code
 was thrown at me, and I ended up spending too much time trying to understand some parts that I skipped through others.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used ChatGPT to explain how different parts of the code worked, and to help explain parts of the tutorial I didn't understand. I also used it to help me remember how to do some styling with CSS that I forgot. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I don't even know what to say because so much is still unclear to me. I think the main thing I'd like to understand is formatting. How do we know where to put stuff and when? What is the best way to read JavaScript and interpret the different parts? It can be so much to look at, I don't know where to start.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned more about document.querySelector and how to use it. Although I am still confused about everything, that part is starting to make more sense to me.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Not sure where to start. Most of it was challenging for me, but I think it comes down to my lack of understanding of the fundamentals. And, without that base, it causes me to panic and start spiraling. 
There are just so many little things to add or think about. And with there being different ways to go about stuff with the storyteller assignment, I was trying so hard to understand specific parts, and making myself more confused. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
Initially, I was using ChatGPT to explain to me how things worked or to break down assignments into smaller steps for me to follow. 
Eventually, IO did have to switch to Copilot to help me make the storyteller assignment. Because I was so confused. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
How, exactly, the click function works. How to set that up properly. I really just want to say all of it is unclear. But I am just in a stuck place, and I will get out of it. Hopefully, things will start clicking for me.

## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
I learned about conditionals, if and else, and else if. And how you can use them to enable an action to happen under the right circumstances. As well as different operators, logical and comparison. I also learned more about querySelector.
​
​
### What Was Hard
The variables in Figma, although I basically understand them and how to use them. It is just the kind of thing I need to learn how to actually apply properly to my designs. I get a little confused.
I was also confused with the storyteller tutorial, the last step with forEach, and the function updateProgress stuff. To make the dots light up and progress, that stuff was the only part I didn't quite get.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I only used AI to help me make the storyteller tutorial loop back to the first image. Since that was something I still didn't know how to and it didn't explain it. But I first guessed on how I thought. WHen it was wrong, I got AI's help to fix what I'd done. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
The forEach, and making things like dots light up and stay that way as you interact with it, and then reset. That code was confusing for me.
